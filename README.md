# Go Learning and Projects

A comprehensive collection of Go learning materials and microservices projects.

## 📚 Learning Materials

Follow the structured learning path in the `learning/` directory:

1. **Variables and Basic Types** (`learning/01-variables/`)
2. **Printing and Formatting** (`learning/02-fmt/`)
3. **Boolean Logic** (`learning/03-booleans/`)
4. **Strings** (`learning/04-strings/`)
5. **Loops** (`learning/05-loops/`)
6. **Arrays and Slices** (`learning/06-arrays/`)
7. **Maps** (`learning/07-maps/`)
8. **Functions** (`learning/08-functions/`)
9. **Receivers (Methods)** (`learning/09-receivers/`)
10. **Pointers** (`learning/10-pointers/`)
11. **Structs** (`learning/11-structs/`)
12. **Pass by Value** (`learning/12-pass-by-value/`)
13. **Packages** (`learning/13-packages/`)

## 🚀 Projects

Future microservices and projects will be added to the `projects/` directory.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# Run all learning examples
cd learning && ../scripts/run-all-examples.sh

# Run individual examples
cd learning/01-variables && go run main.go
```

## 📖 Documentation

- [Learning Path](docs/learning-path.md)

## 🎯 Learning Path

Start with variables and work your way through each concept. Each directory contains self-contained examples that build upon previous concepts.

## 🚀 Future Projects

The `projects/` directory is ready for your microservices and other Go projects. Each project should have its own subdirectory with a README explaining its purpose and how to run it.
